Changes from the original design:
  - Modified layout:
      - Wider spacing between D-pad and 8-button clusters.
      - Two Spacebar-like 2.5 - 3U keys to be accessible with thumbs.
      - A Shift-like 2-2.5U key under D-pad.
  - Modified GP2040-CE fork with the ability to address the Case LEDs and display the shmixbox layout on the OLED screen.
  - Street fighter inspired silkscreen art with case window. (Original Open_Core0 WASD art and window was removed)

Planned Changes:
  - Adjust switch spacing to comfortably fit MX-style caps in combination with Choc V2 switches.
  - Experimental Bridging of both thumb keys with one big spacebar keycap.
  - Replace 3U (?) stabilizer footprints and replace with 2.5U or find a combination that supports the bridging goal above.
  - Art cutout and acrylic plate files.

## Ordering and Assembling

With substituting the additional instructions below where applicable, the same instructions from Open_Core0 WASD can be followed from [here](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/tree/main/Boards/GP2040-CE%20Official%20Controllers/Open_Core0%20WASD) (Make sure to use the hardware files from this repo)

### Additional Instructions
  - 16x Choc V1 or V2 switches (V1 recommended before the switch footprint spacing is adjusted).
  - 16x V1 or V2 keycaps.
  - 1x 2U Keycaps.
  - 2x 2-2.5U Keycaps.
  - Build or grab a prebuilt release of the firmware from [GP2040-CE-shmixbox](https://github.com/xKynn/GP2040-CE-shmixbox) instead of the Open_Core0 WASD firmware.
